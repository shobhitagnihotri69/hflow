"""Which stages a recording still needs, asked of the catalog rather than redone.

Re-ingesting a corpus used to redo every stage on every episode: the
transcode, the ffmpeg decode the camera checks share, the contact sheets.
``sync`` already stopped redoing the transcode when the source bytes, the
pipeline version and the encoder all match what it last recorded (see
:meth:`hflow.App.process`). This module does the same for the rest of the
graph.

It is one question, asked per episode and per step: **has this step already
recorded an outcome against this exact episode content, at the version the
step has now?** Neither identity is ordered. ``episode_id`` hashes the
canonical bytes, so an episode the transform would now produce differently is
a different id and nothing filed under the old one counts. ``check_version``
is the pipeline author's explicit compatibility promise, so bumping it after a
retuned threshold makes the old rows stop counting. A step is current or it is
not.

Two design decisions carry the correctness of the whole module.

**The plan is computed after ``sync`` has run, never before.** Only then does
``episodes_latest`` name the episode this run actually produced, so the
outstanding-steps question is asked against the right content id. Planning
first would read the PREVIOUS generation's id, and would skip ``meta`` for a
recording whose source bytes had changed underneath it -- the one thing the
catalog genuinely cannot see, since nothing in it hashes the source. That also
removes any need to compare ``pipeline_version`` here: after sync, the episode
the catalog names for a source IS this run's, by construction.

**``sync`` itself is never planned away.** It is both the producer of the
canonical file every later stage reads and its own cache, so leaving it in
means the planner reasons only about whether WORK is current, never about
whether a FILE still exists -- which the catalog cannot answer either. A run
directory someone cleaned out costs one transcode, not a ``FileNotFoundError``
in the middle of the meta stage.

    The same question :func:`plan_outstanding_stages` answers for a direct
    run, asked for one stage and answered in the caller's own vocabulary:
    conf ``uris`` are data-root-relative strings, and the catalog files rows
    under ``source_uri``. Translating between the two is the whole reason this
    is not a bare call at the call site -- computing the identity a second way
    is how a planner ends up querying for rows filed under another name, which
    reads as "everything is outstanding" and quietly does nothing.

    **Call this only after ``sync`` has completed for the same recordings**,
    for the reason in the module docstring: before then the catalog names the
    PREVIOUS generation. The scheduled lane satisfies that by running inside a
    stage sub-DAG, which the master triggers after the sync sub-DAG finished.
    Triggering a stage sub-DAG directly, without a sync pass over recordings
    whose bytes changed, is the one case where this reads a stale id -- the
    same exposure the direct executor has, and what the escape hatch is for.

    ``Stage.SYNC`` is refused rather than answered. It records no step rows and
    is its own cache, so "outstanding" is not a question the catalog can answer
    about it, and an empty answer would filter away the stage that produces the
    canonical file every later stage reads.

    A recording with no episode in the catalog is KEPT, which is the one place
    this deliberately differs from :func:`plan_outstanding_stages`. That
    function drops it, and can, because the direct executor ran sync in the
    same invocation and therefore knows a missing row means sync failed. A
    stage sub-DAG knows no such thing: a directly triggered ``meta`` pass over
    a corpus that was never synced looks identical from the catalog, and
    dropping it would turn the loud ``FileNotFoundError`` that ``hflow ingest
    --profile metadata_backfill`` raises today into a silent skip. Filtering
    exists to stop paying for work that is already done, not to suppress
    failures, so a recording the catalog cannot vouch for is handed on and
    fails exactly as it does now.
