    Two knobs trade sensitivity for legibility, both off by default so the

    rate a frame pair must clear to count as unstable (the resolution floor,
    one pixel per frame, still applies), and ``unstable_min_duration_s`` drops
    unstable runs shorter than it from the intervals. Hand-held footage
    clears the resolution floor almost continuously by fractions of a degree,
    which is real motion but not what a person calls a shaky camera; a
    threshold of a few degrees per second and a quarter second of run leaves
    the spans a viewer would point at. The threshold also enters the unstable
    share and seconds, since they count the same pairs; the duration filter
    shapes the intervals only.

    Requires the ``motion`` extra (``pip install 'hflow[motion]'``). This is the
    one built-in with a dependency outside the core install, because optical flow
    and a RANSAC similarity fit have no numpy-only equivalent that measures the
    same thing.

    Tracks features between adjacent frames, fits a similarity transform to the
    tracks so independently moving subjects are discarded as outliers, converts
    the fit to angular rates, and splits those rates in time: below roughly 1 Hz
    is deliberate camera movement, above it is shake. A pair is unstable when its
    shake exceeds both the deliberate motion in that same pair and the
    instrument's own resolution floor -- so nothing here is a threshold anyone
    chose. Verified on synthetic footage: a static camera and a smooth pan both
    report no unstable footage, while injected shake scales monotonically with
    its amplitude.

    Read ``unstable_share`` next to ``coverage_share``. Footage no transform
    could be fitted to is reported as unclassified rather than as steady, so a
    low coverage means the share describes only the part that was measurable.

    Rates are degrees per second, named ``_dps``. Do not read the frame-to-frame
    difference in :func:`camera_signal_quality` as a stability signal: it cannot
    separate a shaking camera from a moving subject, which is the entire reason

    Separate from :func:`camera_frame_stats` rather than folded into it, because
    a check is the unit of three things at once -- one gate decision, one
    coverage denominator, and one explicit version. Twenty-odd measurements
    under one name would mean a threshold on any of them gating all of them, and
    a deliberate version bump for one definition changing every measurement's
    version. HFlow's adapter caches the instrument's raw output beside the
    workdir MP4, keyed on the measurement definition, FFmpeg version, and filter
    graph. Registering both checks against the same episode therefore pays one
    FFmpeg decode per camera, not two. Both checks use identical graph parameters
    by default, so they share the decode. Override a graph parameter on only one
    check and HFlow decodes again because you asked FFmpeg for a different
    measurement.

    The coding range is measured from the pixels, never read from the
    container's declared range. That tag lies in practice -- a corpus can
    declare limited range while filling the full scale -- and believing it
    published an exposure-defect share off by more than two orders of
    magnitude. ``{topic}/full_range_detected`` records what was measured, and it
    selects which exposure gates apply, so the shares below mean the same thing
    across corpora encoded differently.

    Read ``out_of_legal_range_mean`` together with ``full_range_detected``: on
    full-range footage it is dominated by that range mismatch rather than by any
    defect, so it is an encoding-hygiene signal there, not a quality one.

    These readings are comparable only within one ffmpeg build. Builds disagree
    about absolute luma by more than rounding -- on the same file, ffmpeg 6.1
    range-scales full-range footage to a floor of 8 where the pinned 8.1
    preserves 0, which moves every percentile here and the range-gated shares
    with them. That is why HFlow pins its own binary and why
    ``camera_frame_stats`` records which one measured; compare across a pin bump
    only after re-measuring, not by reading old rows next to new ones.

    - ``unrecoverable``: a plausible rate that is neither nominal nor 2x, so
