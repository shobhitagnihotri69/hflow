"""The batch-oriented episode read interface: the Rust-swappable seam.

Episode reads go through :class:`EpisodeReader`, a batch interface -- decoded
batches in, arrays/bytes out -- never per-message callbacks in the hot loop.
The interface shape is the part that cannot be retrofitted: a future Rust
backend (PyO3 over the official mcap crate, shipped as a separate wheel) must
drop in behind this protocol unchanged, parity-tested against the pure-Python
backend below. This is the frozen shape that backend implements: the seam is
keyed by CHANNEL id (``channels()`` is the authoritative accessor; parity
tests operate on it), and ``topics()`` is a derived convenience view that
refuses ambiguous files.

Guarantees:

- Within a channel, batches and messages within a batch are ascending in
  ``log_time``. No ordering is guaranteed across channels.
- ``data`` payloads are raw encoded message bytes; decoding happens above the
  seam (see ``hflow.episode``).
